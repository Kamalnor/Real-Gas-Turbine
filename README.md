# Real-Gas-Turbine
Explainable anomaly detection of real gas turbine
The prediction, anomaly detection and Consistency metric evaluation files are located in each folder: LSTM-P2, LSTM-P4, LSTM-T4, LSTM-N1. The matlab files for Cusum anomaly detection with file name 'AD.mat' are located in each Anomaly detection folder. 'AD.csv' is the output of anomaly detection data (rolling std deviation of the AU uncertainty) from Jupyter Notebook. 
The additional files for Consistency metric evaluation are located in folder: LSTM-P2-2, LSTM-P4-2, LSTM-T4-2, LSTM-N1-2
