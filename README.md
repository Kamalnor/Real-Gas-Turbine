# Real-Gas-Turbine
Explainable anomaly detection of real gas turbine
The Jupyter Notebook code for prediction, anomaly detection and Consistency metric evaluation are located in each model's folder: LSTM-P2, LSTM-P4, LSTM-T4, LSTM-N1. The matlab file for Cusum anomaly detection under the file name 'AD.mat' is located in Anomaly detection folder in each model's folder. 'AD.csv' is the output of anomaly detection data (rolling std deviation of the AU uncertainty) from Jupyter Notebook. The force plots linked to the anomaly detection are also located in the Anomaly detection folder. 
The additional files for Consistency metric evaluation are located in folder: LSTM-P2-2, LSTM-P4-2, LSTM-T4-2, LSTM-N1-2
